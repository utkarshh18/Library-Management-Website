                        <p>“Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes
                            drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don’t matter at
                            all, because once you are Real you can’t be ugly, except to people who don’t understand.” —

                        <p>"People who succeed have momentum. The more they succeed, the more they want to succeed and
                            the more they find a way to succeed. Similarly, when someone is failing, the tendency is to
                            get on a downward spiral that can even become a self-fulfilling prophecy." -Tony Robbins</p>

                        <p>"Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by
                            the ones you did do. So, throw off the bowlines, sail away from safe harbor, catch the trade
                            winds in your sails. Explore, Dream, Discover." -Mark Twain</p>
